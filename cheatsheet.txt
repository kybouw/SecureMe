Kyle, use this if you forget stuff

edit your file
use 'git add .' to add all files in the folder, or just 'git add filename' for one
Commit your changes 'git commit -m "message"'
push your commits to your pi 'git push cpix master'

The name of your remote is cpix
master is a branch, you can make other branches if you need.
