Hello, I welcome all users to try, use, and contribute to this project. It is simply a tool that helps beef up the security of out-of-the-box Ubuntu distros, as well as clean up the garbage on used ones. Enjoy!

# How to use this tool
Here is a quick guide for using this script

1. You must have all the files in one folder
2. You must make the main.sh file executable `$ sudo chmod +x main.sh`
3. You run the main.sh file like so... `$ sudo ./main.sh`
4. Follow the pompts along the way, it may take some time.

And that's all there is to it!
