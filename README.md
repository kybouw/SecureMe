This is an old tool written by myself (IIRC, a lot of it probably gleaned from the internet) when I was just a wee skiddie. I have not used it in a long time, so it might not work. I used it in a competitive setting, so it probably is not useful for production systems. Take a look at the code, and comment out anything that looks risky. It is organized into neat little functions so that you can easily toggle certain blocks of it-- just comment out the function call in `main`.

# How to use this tool
Here is a quick guide for using this script

1. You must have all the files in one folder
2. You must make the main.sh file executable `$ sudo chmod +x main.sh`
3. You run the main.sh file like so... `$ sudo ./main.sh`
4. Follow the pompts along the way, it may take some time.

And that's all there is to it!
